31.05.23 Made UML database diagram in Dia.

01.06.23
Briefly compiled the technical task.
Create database:
	CREATE DATABASE brief_news
	CHARACTER SET utf8
	COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
Create database user:
	CREATE USER 'brief_news_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'standart';
	the password is hidden because the development log will be on GitHub.
Grant privileges to database user:
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON brief_news.* TO 'brief_news_user'@'localhost';
Installed Laravel application:
	composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel briefNews
Initialized git repository:
	git init, git add ., git commit
further work with Git will not be described, look at the commits

02.06.23
Added new requirements to the technical task.
In the UML database diagram in Article table added the "status" field.
Added Laravel/UI package to the application:
	composer require laravel/ui
Running the package:
	php artisan ui:auth
Deleted in view resources\views\layouts\app.blade.php line:
	@vite(['resources/sass/app.scss', 'resources/js/app.js'])
To edit database tables add the doctrine/dbal package to the application:
	composer require doctrine/dbal

05.06.23
In the UML database diagram in Article table deleted the "status" field. It
repeats the functionality of "soft delete".
The preselected third normal form (3nf) of database.

06.06.23
The database structure conditionally corresponds to 3nf. Rows may be repeated
in the "sources_links" table because different articles may have the same sources.
To resolve the inconsistency, you must declare the "link" field unique and make a
many-to-many relationship in the "articles" and "sources_links" tables. But in my
humble opinion, it's overhead.
In UML DB make some changes for "soft delete".
Created Migrations for tables "articles" and "sources_links":
	php artisan make:migration create_articles_table
	php artisan make:migration create_sources_links_table
Added to migration "users" field: softDeletes (look in code).
Added to migration "articles" fields: user_id, header, body, policy, economy, science,
	technologies, sport, other, world, local, softDeletes.
Added to migration "sources_links" fields: article_id, link, softDeletes.
In file .env added DB settings: DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD.
Applying migrations:
	php artisan migrate
Dumped DB in MYSQL:
	mysqldump -uroot -p brief_news > brief_news.sql

07.06.23
Make models for a tables articles and sources_links:
	php artisan make:model Article
	php artisan make:model SourceLink
Because the model 'SourceLink' doesn't follow the naming rules, added a property
explicitly specifying the DB table.
Defined the fields available for mass assignment in models Article and SourceLink.
Added one-to-many relationship methods between models User and Article.
Added one-to-many relationship methods between models Article and SourceLink.

08.06.23
Found a mistake: migration of the user table does not match the design UML table.
In UML DB in the 'user' table changed the type column 'role' and 'status'.
Added to migration "users" field: surname, nickname, role, status.
Rollbacking all migrations:
	php artisan migrate:rollback
Applying migrations:
	php artisan migrate
Dumped DB in MYSQL:
	mysqldump -uroot -p brief_news > brief_news.sql

09.06.23
Added the fields available for mass assignment in model User: surname, nickname, role, status.
Adding the root user in DB:
Сreate a "seed":
	php artisan make:seeder UserRootSeeder
Adding to the "seed" the code that creates the user in the database.
Apply 'seed':
	php artisan db:seed --class=UserRootSeeder
Checking the interaction of models with database tables:
Сreate a "seed":
	php artisan make:seeder UserArticleLinkSeeder
Adding to the "seed" the code that creates the writer, article, and link,
and saves it in the database.
Apply 'seed':
	php artisan db:seed --class=UserArticleLinkSeeder
Dumped DB in MYSQL:
	mysqldump -uroot -p brief_news > brief_news.sql

10.06.23
Сhanged the method of generating words for the article in UserArticleLinkSeeder.
Recreated the database.
Dumped DB in MYSQL.

12.06.23 Working with the technical task.

13.06.23 Working with the technical task.

14.06.23 Finished the technical task (at least at this stage of development).
An error was found in the database structure. Combinations of rubrics in the articles table and users table will be repeated. Need to add rubrics_combinations table.

15.06.23
To fix an error in database structure:
Created Migrations for table "rubrics_combinations":
	php artisan make:migration create_rubrics_combinations_table
Changed migrations according to the UML diagram.
Make model for a table rubrics_combinations:
	php artisan make:model RubricsCombination
Changed Models according to the UML diagram.
Сreate a RubricsCombination "seed":
	php artisan make:seeder RubricsCombinationSeeder

16.06.23
Made the logic of filling the table in RubricsCombinationSeeder.
Recreated the database.
Dumped DB in MYSQL.

19.06.23
Сreate basic.blade.php in layouts.
Сreate home.blade.php in views.
planned the structure of controllers.

21.06.23
In view created user interface buttons.
Selected test password 1077 for all users.
Created user with admin role (seed).
Created user with reader role (web interface).
Tested user interface buttons on all roles (manual testing).

26.06.23
Work on the rubrics sorting panel:
Sketched View;
Skethed Controller.

27.06.23
Continuation of work on the rubrics sorting panel:
Continuation of work on the Controller.

28.06.23
Continuation of work on the rubrics sorting panel:
Continuation of work on the Controller;
The development of the logic for pressing the buttons "Panel for sorting articles by headings and locale" has been completed.

29.06.23
Continuation of work on the rubrics sorting panel:
Made a 'rubrics combination' in the Сontroller.
Moved the logic for "Panel for sorting articles by headings and locale" to a trait ConverterRubricsCombination.
Made buttons for "Panel for sorting articles by headings and locale" in View.

30.06.23
Began making the "news" section in the controller.

03.07.23
Make "Eager Loading By Default" in the Article model.

04.07.23
Made the "news" section in the Home view.
Continue to make the "news" section in the Home controller.

05.07.23
Started making controller logic for building a query to the database for fetching articles.

06.07.23
Continued making controller logic for building a query to the database for fetching articles.

07.07.23
Сompleted controller logic for building a query to the database for fetching articles.
Some Controller code refactoring.

10.07.23
In view hid the body of the article with a tag <details>, later will be finalized according to the requirements of the technical task.
Pagination:
Retrieving pagination views so they can be modified:
	php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-pagination
Change arrow size <Previous Next> in file resources/views/vendor/pagination/tailwind.blade.php
A problem was detected: the standard paginator didn't work with the "Panel for sorting articles by headings and locale".

11.07.23
Finding a solution to a problem discovered earlier.
Found a solution:
	https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pagination#appending-query-string-values
Summary: added paginator to Home view and Home controller

12.07.23
Article CRUD:
Create a resource controller that will implement CRUD logic for articles:
	php artisan make:controller ArticleController --resource
Created a route for resource Controller:
	Route::resource('articles', ArticleController::class)
Written logic in index method in ArticleController for a display of the 'My Articles' page.
For 'My Articles' view reused the 'Home' view, so made some changes in the view.

13.07.23
Fixed a bug in trait ConverterRubricsCombination:
when authenticating a user (and loading a rubrics combination), the 'all' button was always enabled.

14.07.23
Create article:
In ArticleController added logic in the 'create' method to show a create article page.
Make create.blade.php view. Because there will be an indefinite number of "sources links", it is necessary to apply on the page JavaScript to form 'inputs'
Working with JavaScript.

17.07.23
Working with JavaScript.
In create.blade.php view maked form with rubrics combinations.

18.07.23
Made the some logic in the store method.

20.07.23
Final сhanges of create.blade.php, store method and IdRubricsCombination trait.
Create article is done.
