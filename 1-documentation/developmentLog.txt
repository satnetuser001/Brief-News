31.05.23 Made UML database diagram in Dia.

01.06.23
Briefly compiled the technical task.
Create database:
	CREATE DATABASE brief_news
	CHARACTER SET utf8
	COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
Create database user:
	CREATE USER 'brief_news_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'standart';
	the password is hidden because the development log will be on GitHub.
Grant privileges to database user:
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON brief_news.* TO 'brief_news_user'@'localhost';
Installed Laravel application:
	composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel briefNews
Initialized git repository:
	git init, git add ., git commit
further work with Git will not be described, look at the commits

02.06.23
Added new requirements to the technical task.
In the UML database diagram in Article table added the "status" field.
Added Laravel/UI package to the application:
	composer require laravel/ui
Running the package:
	php artisan ui:auth
Deleted in view resources\views\layouts\app.blade.php line:
	@vite(['resources/sass/app.scss', 'resources/js/app.js'])
To edit database tables add the doctrine/dbal package to the application:
	composer require doctrine/dbal

05.06.23
In the UML database diagram in Article table deleted the "status" field. It
repeats the functionality of "soft delete".
The preselected third normal form (3nf) of database.

06.06.23
The database structure conditionally corresponds to 3nf. Rows may be repeated
in the "sources_links" table because different articles may have the same sources.
To resolve the inconsistency, you must declare the "link" field unique and make a
many-to-many relationship in the "articles" and "sources_links" tables. But in my
humble opinion, it's overhead.
In UML DB make some changes for "soft delete".
Created Migrations for tables "articles" and "sources_links":
	php artisan make:migration create_articles_table
	php artisan make:migration create_sources_links_table
Added to migration "users" field: softDeletes (look in code).
Added to migration "articles" fields: user_id, header, body, policy, economy, science,
	technologies, sport, other, world, local, softDeletes.
Added to migration "sources_links" fields: article_id, link, softDeletes.
In file .env added DB settings: DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD.
Applying migrations:
	php artisan migrate
Dumped DB in MYSQL:
	mysqldump -uroot -p brief_news > brief_news.sql

07.06.23
Make models for a tables articles and sources_links:
	php artisan make:model Article
	php artisan make:model SourceLink
Because the model 'SourceLink' doesn't follow the naming rules, added a property
explicitly specifying the DB table.
Defined the fields available for mass assignment in models Article and SourceLink.
Added one-to-many relationship methods between models User and Article.
Added one-to-many relationship methods between models Article and SourceLink.

08.06.23
Found a mistake: migration of the user table does not match the design UML table.
In UML DB in the 'user' table changed the type column 'role' and 'status'.
Added to migration "users" field: surname, nickname, role, status.
Rollbacking all migrations:
	php artisan migrate:rollback
Applying migrations:
	php artisan migrate
Dumped DB in MYSQL:
	mysqldump -uroot -p brief_news > brief_news.sql

09.06.23
Added the fields available for mass assignment in model User: surname, nickname, role, status.
Adding the root user in DB:
Сreate a "seed":
	php artisan make:seeder UserRootSeeder
Adding to the "seed" the code that creates the user in the database.
Apply 'seed':
	php artisan db:seed --class=UserRootSeeder
Checking the interaction of models with database tables:
Сreate a "seed":
	php artisan make:seeder UserArticleLinkSeeder
Adding to the "seed" the code that creates the writer, article, and link,
and saves it in the database.
Apply 'seed':
	php artisan db:seed --class=UserArticleLinkSeeder
Dumped DB in MYSQL:
	mysqldump -uroot -p brief_news > brief_news.sql

10.06.23
Сhanged the method of generating words for the article in UserArticleLinkSeeder.
Recreated the database.
Dumped DB in MYSQL.

12.06.23 Working with the technical task.

13.06.23 Working with the technical task.

14.06.23 Finished the technical task (at least at this stage of development).
An error was found in the database structure. Need to add another table.
